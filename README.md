## Customize your Résumé

To edit the content and design of your résumé, follow these steps:

### 1. Personal Details

Open `src/data/author.json` and edit the information describing yourself. The following properties are supported (optional properties can be removed from the JSON file):

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Key</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>Required</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><code>name</code></td>
            <td>your full name</td>
            <td>required</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>occupation</code></td>
            <td>your job description</td>
            <td>required</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>location</code></td>
            <td>your town/state</td>
            <td>optional</td>
        </tr>

            <td>your preferred <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferred_gender_pronoun">gender pronouns</a></td>
            <td>optional</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>email</code></td>
            <td>your email address</td>
            <td>optional</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>telephone</code></td>
            <td>your phone number</td>
            <td>optional</td>

            <td>optional</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>languages</code></td>
            <td>an array of objects describing your spoken languages; each object should include a <code>name</code> (e.g. "English") and <code>level</code> (e.g. "fluent") property</td>
            <td>optional</td>
        </tr>

        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

### 2. Introduction

Open `entries/content/introduction.md` and edit the text content of the file with your personal short introduction summary. Limit it to 2-3 sentences and convey your motivation. You can edit the title of the section here as well. 

### 3. Work Experience & Education

The entries for the sections "work experience" and "education" are stored as markdown files in `src/entries/work` and `src/entries/education`.

Delete the demo files in there and create your own. The text should describe your responsibilities, learnings or achievements. Include the following [frontmatter](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-frontmatter/) data:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Key</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>Required</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><code>title</code></td>
            <td>the title of the entry. in "work experience", this sould be your role/position, in "education" this should be the degree/certification earned.</td>
            <td>required</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>start</code></td>
            <td>ISO timestamp of when you started this job or education.</td>
            <td>required</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>end</code></td>
            <td>ISO timestamp of when you ended this job or education. If not defined, that entry will say "- Present"</td>
            <td>optional</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>organization</code></td>
            <td>name of your employer (when "work") or school (when "education")</td>
            <td>optional</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>organizationUrl</code></td>
            <td>link to website of your employer (when "work") or school (when "education")</td>
            <td>optional</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>location</code></td>
            <td>location of company or school</td>
            <td>optional</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

### 4. Github Repositories

If you want, you can include the five most starred repositories from your Github account. This will fetch the current data at build time, at most once a day. To do this, edit `src/data/repositories.js` and change the `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` var to your Github username.

### 5. Custom Content

Edit `entries/content/custom.md` if you want to edit freeform content to the end of the CV. This could be a legal disclaimer or an additional section. Delete the file if you don't want this section to show up. 

### 6. Meta Data & Design

Open `src/data/meta.json` and replace the `url` with the URL of your hosted résumé. You can also customize the language and color scheme here.

Supported properties are:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Key</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>Required</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><code>url</code></td>
            <td>the URL of your hosted résumé, e.g. <code>"https://my-resume.com"</code>. (no trailing slash)</td>
            <td>required</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>lang</code></td>
            <td>the 2-digit language identifier of your résumé, e.g. "en", "de", etc.</td>
            <td>required</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>locale</code></td>
            <td>the locale code of your résumé, e.g. "en_US", "de_DE", etc.</td>
            <td>required</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>colors.primary</code></td>
            <td>The HEX code of the primary brand color. defaults to blue <code>#005b96</code></td>
            <td>optional</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>colors.secondary</code></td>
            <td>The HEX code of the secondary brand color. defaults to red <code>#fc6767</code></td>
            <td>optional</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

### 7. Internationalization

There are a few hardcoded english strings used in the template, such as the section titles and some labels. If you want to change the default language from english to something else, you can translate these strings by changing the values in `data/strings.json`.
